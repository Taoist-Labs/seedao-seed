The "Tai Chi Star" color between the brows of the Seed NFT character will dynamically change based on the amount of $SCR in the owner's wallet. All on-chain avatars will display this dynamic feature. The color of the Tai Chi Star is linked solely to the current holder's tier and will update to reflect the new holder's tier after a transaction.
